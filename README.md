# MS-L_Minesweeper-in-Python
A legacy minesweeper project completed near December 2018. Working game with a GUI, configurable size, and a hint system. 

# Instructions
Make sure at least Python 3.7 exists on your system, and simply run the .py file.

# Comments 
This was made as a final project in a college course in fall 2018 as I was beginning to learn programming that semester. There are improvements to be made, but it works. I revisted the project and performed a light review of the code to reflect on what could be improved.

This project is purely python despite what GitHub might say.
